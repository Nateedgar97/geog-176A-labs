### Why at 0 stage, are we capturing impacted buildings?
### Because certain buildings on this map are so close to the river, remote sensing itslef isn't at the ability yet to capture this small of a difference between these specific buildings and the rivers nearby and because of this, Rstudios is also not able to then show this as well.
